This is a side project where I will attempt to implement an NES emulator from scratch. This has the additional benefit of me learning some C++.

UPDATE OCT. 23, 2015

So, progress has been slow but steady. At this point I am starting to test the CPU thoroughly. You could argue that I should have implemented the CPU's memory more solidly. Admittedly I have been putting it off because I am not exactly sure how the memory mapping works quite yet. Once the CPU has been tested and I am sure that it works reliably I will probably implement memory.
